                <h4>Mission</h4>
                <p>
                    To document and openly share the locations, patterns, and behaviors associated
                    with Sasquatch encounters, and to preserve this information in a way that allows
                    real analysis rather than endless speculation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This project is not about convincing people that Sasquatches exist. That question
                    is already settled for many who have experienced encounters firsthand.
                </p>

                <p>
                    People’s lives have been disrupted—sometimes permanently—by encounters they never
                    asked for. I’m one of them. Many others have no platform, no context, and no way to
                    understand what happened to them.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Governments in the United States and Canada continue to deny the existence—and
                    full capabilities—of these beings. Meanwhile, witnesses are dismissed, ridiculed,
                    or ignored. This platform exists to preserve data and allow patterns to speak for
                    themselves.
                </p>

                <h4>About the Project</h4>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest problems in the cryptid community is fragmentation. Encounter
                    reports, media, and analysis are scattered across social platforms, forums, and
                    isolated websites, making it difficult to see patterns or validate correlations.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Mapping Sasquatch is an open-source project designed to centralize historical and
                    modern encounter data into a single, durable platform. The goal is to create a
                    level playing field where all aspects of encounters can be shared openly, without
                    gatekeeping or hidden narratives.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This platform modernizes how this information is stored, visualized, and explored,
                    using mapping, filtering, and AI-assisted analysis to surface patterns that would
                    otherwise remain invisible.
                </p>

                <h4>Keep This Information Free</h4>
                <p>
                    This project is supported entirely by community funding via{" "}
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/mapping-sasquatch">
                        GoFundMe
                    </a>.
                    There are no paywalls. As long as governments deny the existence of these beings,
                    this information should remain public. People deserve to know where encounters are
                    happening and what others are experiencing.
                </p>

                <h4>Features</h4>
                <p>
                    Planned and potential features include advanced mapping and filtering of sightings,
                    AI-assisted pattern detection across geography and time, audio and vocalization
                    analysis, media correlation, DNA and biological data visualization using publicly
                    available studies, and environmental overlays such as terrain, water sources,
                    elevation, and remoteness.
                </p>

                <p>
                    AI is used to organize and analyze large datasets—not to draw conclusions or tell
                    anyone what to believe. Features are built based on community feedback and voting.
                </p>

                <h4>Videos / Media / Social</h4>
                <p>
                    I’m not producing video content yet. If the community grows, I’ll engage wherever
                    it makes the most sense, starting with X (Twitter). Other platforms may include
                    YouTube, Discord, Telegram, or Rumble.
                </p>

                <h4>The Future</h4>
                <p>
                    If done right, this platform will outpace existing forms of reporting by providing
                    structured, open, and analyzable data. Long-term sustainability may require ongoing
                    community support. Those decisions will be made later.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My name is Brandon Chambers. I’m a software engineer with over 20 years of
                    professional experience building and scaling web platforms. I built this platform because the community deserves
                    better tools to preserve and understand this information.

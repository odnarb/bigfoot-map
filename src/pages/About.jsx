            <div className="card">
                <h4>Mission</h4>
                <p>To document, and dissiminate the location and whereabouts of all cryptids, including aliens.
                To share the attributes of these creatures including the true nature of their capabilities in and out of this realm.</p>

                <p>There's no way that thousands upon thousands of reports of these beings are fake. Peoples' lives have been ruined by these various beings.
                The people who have been affected did not ask for their experience. I know I didn't ask for my encounter with a sasquatch.</p>

                <p>We are being gaslit and lied to about the existence of these beings and their full capabilities by our governments.</p>

                <h4>About The Project</h4>
                <p>One of the problems I see with the cryptid community is that information is shared across multiple platforms.</p>
                <p>I want to have a central place where I might be able to see patterns, and learn more about these creatures in a different way.</p>
                <p>My ultimate goal is to unite the cryptid community with a level playing field, where ALL aspects of encounters are shared, and nothing is hidden.</p>

                <p>Cryptid Maps is an open source project. I'll be collecting historical and modern data alike. If there's already a project out there like this I haven't seen it yet.</p>

                <p>This is my attempt to modernize the information into a real database. Something that can be easily moved and maintained.</p>

                <h4>About Me</h4>
                <p>I am a software engineer, or developer. I've been building websites and complex web-based platforms and have scaled them for about 15 years professionally and all 25 years for fun.</p>
                <p>I decided it's about time the community gets something akin to an upgrade in dissiminating this class of information.</p>

                <h4>Keep this Information Free</h4>
                <p>The only way I can keep this project going is from funding from everyone. I don't have paywalls.
                I promise for as long as the governments deny these beings exist it will remain free.
                The location of these beings must be public domain for the time being.
                We must know where people are encountering them.</p>

                <p>I'm open to other ideas that can add to the data bank here or types of information like visualization of DNA sequences, or vocalizations (like ThinkerThunker does)</p>
                <p>Of course video and pictures are a thing, but I think I would build whatever people ask for first and what people vote on.</p>
                <p>I don't do videos just yet, but if I gain a following I will happily engage with you guys in whatever social media way seems best, starting with X/Twitter.</p>
                <p>Other options include Discord, Telegram, and Rumble.</p>

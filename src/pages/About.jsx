            <div className="card">
                <h4>Mission</h4>
                <p>To document and disseminate the location and whereabouts of sasquatches. To share the attributes of these creatures, including the true nature of their capabilities in and out of this realm.</p>

                <p>I'm not here to convince people of the existence of sasquatches. We're quite beyond that.</p>

                <p>People's lives have been ruined by these things. The people who have been affected did not ask for their experience. Me either.</p>
                <p>We are being gaslit and lied to about the existence of these beings and their full capabilities by our governments in the USA and Canada.</p>

                <h4>About The Project</h4>
                <p>One of the problems I see with the cryptid community is that information is shared across multiple platforms.We need a central place where we might be able to see patterns and learn more about these creatures in a different way.
                My ultimate goal is to unite the cryptid community with a level playing field, where ALL aspects of encounters are shared, and nothing is hidden.</p>

                <p>Mapping Bigfoot is an open-source project. I'll be collecting historical and modern data alike. If there's already a project out there like this with GoogleMaps visualizations, filtering and whatnot with different disparate datasets mashed together I haven't seen it.</p>

                <p>This is my attempt to modernize the information into a real platform and database. Something that can be easily moved and maintained.</p>

                <h4>Keep this Information Free</h4>
                <p>The only way I can keep this project going is from funding from everyone. I don't have paywalls. I promise for as long as the governments deny these beings exist, it will remain free. The location of these beings must be public domain for the time being. We must know where people are encountering them.</p>

                <h4>Features</h4>
                <p>I'm open to other ideas that can add to the data bank here or types of information like visualization of DNA sequences (Dr. Melba Ketchum studies) or vocalizations (like ThinkerThunker does).
                Of course, video and pictures are a thing, but I think I would build whatever people ask for first and what people vote on.</p>

                <h4>Videos/Media/Social Media</h4>
                <p>I don't do videos just yet, but if I gain a following, I will happily engage with you guys in whatever social media way seems best, starting with X/Twitter.
                Other options include YouTube, Discord, Telegram, Rumble, etc.</p>

                <h4>The Future</h4>
                <p>If I do my job well, this platform will outpace all other forms of reporting and will likely require consistent monthly investment from the community. We'll leave that to the future. A genius once said "When you get to the fork in the road, take it", so we'll leave those problems for later, if there is one.</p>

                <h4>About Me</h4>
                <p>My name is Brandon Chambers. I'm a software engineer and I've been building websites, complex web-based platforms, and have scaled them for about 15 years professionally and all 25 years for fun.
                I decided it's about time the community gets something akin to an upgrade in disseminating this class of information.</p>
